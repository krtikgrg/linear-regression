Our Assumptions:

1.) Since we had 10 models for each of the degrees therefore we should be talking about the average values of the bias, varaince, bias square, irreducible error.
2.) Bias and Bias Square are talked differently because of the fact since we are taking average and we have a formula for individual biases, therefore calculating the individual absolute biases and taking their averages for the overall bias and for bias square taking average of the square of individual squares of biases.
3.) By individual biases i mean that bias of each of the test points which is calculated by evaluating first the average of my predicted value for a particular test point.
4.) For variance similarly taking average of (f(x)-avg(f^(x))) for each of the test points of each of the 10 models for each degree, where the avg(f^(x)) is the average value of my prediction for a particular test point calculated over the 10 models.
5.) For Mean squared error taking average of (f(x)-f^(x)) for each of test points of each of the 10 models for each degree.
